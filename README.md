Tutorials
=========

This repository holds pointers to executable tutorials in the Python data
science ecosystem (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, etc..).  It uses the following
resources:

1.  Existing tutorial materials from conferences
3.  Links to existing videos from conferences
2.  The public MyBinder deployment to quickly launch executable notebooks

The goal is to provide a central place where users that are new to the
ecosystem can quickly find and leverage existing educational material that the
community produces within technical conferences.
